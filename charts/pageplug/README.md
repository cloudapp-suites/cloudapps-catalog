## What is PagePlug?

PagePlug is a localized version of [Appsmith](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith) for China. It is an open-source, declarative, visual frontend low-code framework that can be used to create web applications and WeChat Mini Programs.

> The current source code version is v1.9.39, the community edition (CE) image version is v1.9.39, and the enterprise edition (EE) image version is v1.10. After the enterprise edition v1.11 update is pushed, the community edition v1.9.39 update will also be pushed. Please stay tuned.

Remember to give the open-source contributors a star 🌟 on GitHub to show your support~

## How is PagePlug different from other low-code platforms?

PagePlug targets a different user group compared to other low-code platforms on the market (such as QingFlow, YiDa, WeiDa, Jiandaoyun, Huozige, etc.). The latter tend to target non-programming personnel, allowing business staff to build applications themselves. In contrast, PagePlug is designed for R&D personnel (To D), aiming to accelerate developers' development process and make developing internal systems and tools simpler.

<p>

</p>

Although PagePlug, like other no-code and low-code platforms, aims to make it easier for people to create applications and automate processes, it offers more powerful and flexible API and data management capabilities. Without intruding into customer architectures, it directly connects to data sources (APIs, databases), transforming any backend data into JavaScript variables that can be freely converted and configured to any view components. Therefore, for users who need higher customization and broader operations, PagePlug may be a better choice.

## Key Features

- More powerful visual modeling tools

PagePlug has very intuitive and flexible visual modeling tools such as tables, charts, forms, buttons, etc. These components are optimized and tested to meet most business requirements, thereby reducing developers' workload and avoiding extensive coding and testing work. Developers can more easily drag and drop various components as needed to create custom forms, reports, and applications without repeatedly writing complex code, and the maintenance of the entire software becomes lighter.

</p>

- Broader API support

PagePlug supports integration with numerous third-party APIs, including data storage, message queues, file uploads, etc., allowing developers to integrate various functionalities more easily and seamlessly integrate with their own applications to extend application capabilities.

</p>

- More complete data management capabilities

PagePlug provides powerful data management tools, allowing users to easily write and execute SQL queries, manage databases, tables, and other data resources. Compared to other low-code platforms, PagePlug connects to APIs and database servers without manual configuration, with built-in engine support.

<p>

</p>

- Greater extensibility

PagePlug supports writing custom code in JavaScript anywhere, and currently also supports adding third-party JS libraries, allowing convenient customization of components and control logic to better fulfill personalized requirements.

</p>

- Better security support

PagePlug provides extensive security support, including authentication, authorization, encryption, auditing, etc., ensuring your applications are secure and reliable.

## Differences from Appsmith

- Fully localized and performance-optimized based on Appsmith for a better experience

Simplified startup steps, supporting local development on Windows environments (without WSL). The official AppSmith frontend project has tedious first-time startup steps with many dependencies, and official Windows platform local development support is implemented through WSL, making configuration very cumbersome!

- Introduced the Ant Design component library, supporting Antd5, with React upgraded to v18

- Rich mobile components, supporting mobile! Create a mini program in one minute and generate a QR code for sharing!

### 🎈 Local Development

PagePlug code is located in the /app directory, with the main directories being:

- /client -- React frontend project, generated using create-react-app scaffolding, responsible for the low-code editor and web display
- /server -- Java backend project, using Spring WebFlux framework, responsible for low-code backend services and various data source proxies
- /taro -- Taro mobile project, using Taro cross-platform solution to implement mobile parsing and display of low-code DSL

#### Starting PagePlug Frontend

The PagePlug frontend project uses Nginx as a gateway, with Nginx running in Docker. Please ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) is installed before running. The following startup commands are for **Windows** environments only. For non-Windows environments, please refer to the [official guide](/contributions/ClientSetup.md).

```
// Configure host
127.0.0.1 dev.appsmith.com

// Environment variables
cp .env.example .env

// Start local nginx docker
cd app/client
yarn start-proxy

// Start frontend service
yarn
yarn start-win
```

After successful startup, visit [https://dev.appsmith.com](https://dev.appsmith.com/) to preview.

#### Starting PagePlug Backend

Starting the PagePlug backend requires JDK11, Maven3, a MongoDB instance, and a Redis instance. For specific operations, please refer to the [official guide](/contributions/ServerSetup.md). The following startup commands are for **Windows** environments only. Running scripts in Windows environments requires bash commands. For non-Windows environments, run scripts directly.

> **Note**: The build.sh script uses the rsync tool. Please ensure rsync is installed in your system before starting. For installing rsync in Windows environments, see [here](https://xindot.com/2019/08/13/add-rsync-to-git-bash-for-windows/).

```bash
// Open project with IDEA
app/server

// Create environment variable file
cp envs/dev.env.example .env

// Open .env and configure environment variables
APPSMITH_MONGODB_URI="Your MongoDB instance address"
APPSMITH_REDIS_URL="Your Redis instance address"

// [Optional] If you need Mini Program preview functionality, configure your Mini Program information
CLOUDOS_WECHAT_APPID=""
CLOUDOS_WECHAT_SECRET=""

// Build Java service
mvn clean compile
bash ./build.sh -DskipTests

// Start Java service
bash ./scripts/start-dev-server.sh
```

#### Starting PagePlug Mobile

The PagePlug mobile project is a [Taro](https://github.com/NervJS/taro) project that naturally supports multi-platform Mini Programs, H5, and React Native. However, PagePlug currently only supports WeChat Mini Programs. Previewing and publishing WeChat Mini Programs requires the WeChat Developer Tool and Mini Program account. Please review the [official WeChat Mini Program guide](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/framework/quickstart/getstart.html) before development.
PagePlug mobile components are built using the [Taroify](https://github.com/mallfoundry/taroify) UI component library.

```bash
cd app/taro

Open config/dev.js to configure development parameters

// PagePlug backend API address, needs to be filled with local IP address during local development
API_BASE_URL: '"http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8080/api/"'

// Default application ID displayed in Mini Program
DEFAULT_APP: '"Application ID"'

// Start Taro project
yarn
yarn dev:weapp
```
