# 🤯 Welcome to Activepieces

All-in-one AI automation designed to be **extensible** through a **type-safe** pieces framework written in **TypeScript**.
When you contribute pieces to Activepieces they become automatically available as MCP servers that you can use with LLMs through Claude Desktop, Cursor or Windsurf!

<br>
<br>

## 🔥 Why Activepieces is Different:

- **💖 Loved by Everyone**: Intuitive interface and great experience for both technical and non-technical users with a quick learning curve.

- **🌐 Open Ecosystem:** All pieces are open source and available on npmjs.com, **60% of the pieces are contributed by the community**.

- **🛠️ Largest open source MCP toolkit**: All our pieces (280+) are available as MCP that you can use with LLMs on Claude Desktop, Cursor or Windsurf.

- **🛠️  Pieces are written in Typescript**: Pieces are npm packages in TypeScript, offering full customization with the best developer experience, including **hot reloading** for **local** piece development on your machine. 😎

- **🤖 AI-First**: Native AI pieces let you experiment with various providers, or create your own agents using our AI SDK, and there is Copilot to help you build flows inside the builder.

- **🏢 Enterprise-Ready**: Developers set up the tools, and anyone in the organization can use the no-code builder. Full customization from branding to control.

- **🔒 Secure by Design**: Self-hosted and network-gapped for maximum security and control over your data.

- **🧠 Human in the Loop**: Delay execution for a period of time or require approval. These are just pieces built on top of the piece framework, and you can build many pieces like that. 🎨

- **💻 Human Input Interfaces**: Built-in support for human input triggers like "Chat Interface" 💬 and "Form Interface" 📝
