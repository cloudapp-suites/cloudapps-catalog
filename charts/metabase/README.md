## Get started

The easiest way to get started with Metabase is to sign up for a free trial of [Metabase Cloud](https://store.metabase.com/checkout). You get support, backups, upgrades, an SMTP server, SSL certificate, SoC2 Type 2 security auditing, and more (plus your money goes toward improving Metabase). Check out our quick overview of [cloud vs self-hosting](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/cloud/cloud-vs-self-hosting). If you need to, you can always switch to [self-hosting](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/installation-and-operation/installing-metabase) Metabase at any time (or vice versa).
