## Motivation

- I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like "Uptime Robot", but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the closest ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and no longer maintained.
- Wanted to build a fancy UI.
- Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
- Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
- Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of a REST API.
- Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ‚≠ê.
